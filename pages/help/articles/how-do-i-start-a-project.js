                        You should also keep the payment processing fees in mind

                        organizer to create a MarchRaise, but a 3% fee (which
                        covers debit and credit charges) per donation applies.
                        Beneficiaries receive all funds raised minus the

                        specific amount of funds, considering transaction fees
                        when setting your goal will be important.
